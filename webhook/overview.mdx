## Event Ordering

Covenance cannot guarantee the sequential delivery of events as they occur, nor can it ensure they will be received only once.

## Webhook Retries

If Covenance does not receive a response code of 204 from your server within 10 seconds, it will retry delivery up to 3 times.

## Setup

To begin receiving real-time event notifications of the transactions of a sub account via the webhook, register a webhook for a sub account on the dashboard. 

Once you register a webhook for a sub account, you will receive a payload with the id of the transaction on the POST endpoint you specified when you created the webhook.
A maximum of 10 webhooks can be created.

## Event Payload

```json
{
  "entityId": "<string>",
  "event": "<string>",
  "eventId": "<string>"
}
```
