## Authorization

Convenance uses API Keys to authorize requests. You can generate and regenerate an API Key for a sub account on the dashboard.

Once you have an API Key for a sub account you will be able to create, manage and get the cards and transactions of the sub account by calling the available endpoints.
A maximum of 10 API keys can be created.
