## Authorization

Convenance uses API keys to authorize requests. You can generate and regenerate an API key for your Covenance account on the dashboard.

Once your account has an API key you will be able to create, manage and get the cards and transactions of your sub accounts and create and get your sub accounts and transfer funds from one sub account to another.
